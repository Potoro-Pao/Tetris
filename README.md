# Tetris
To run the program, pip install pygame first.   
The control keys: Left and Right arrows to move the block, Up arrows can rotate the block, Space can speed up the block.   
I prepare the exe file in Master branch to download, if you just want to play the game. There is a Happy version of the game included, too.   
Managed to make the game work. Tetris is one of my favorite childhood game. Will improve my coding skill in the future.
