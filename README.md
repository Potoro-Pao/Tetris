# A fun Bug Version of Tetris that I Want to Keep
After watching the Tetris(film), there is a scene where the original Tetris was found that the program can't clear all the lines at once.
Reminding me of the ealier bug I experienced, so I put it.
Mine is simply an indentation problem, which is at the main loop where I am counting score.

This is not the same code the author of the Tetris does, but I think it's a fun to show that.

Also change the color to green and icon to differentiate it from my original python version.
